i have a folder on my desktop which has hundreds of videos. these video are just different content downloaded from social media & from all over the internet, it has many different types of videos. these videos are not organized / categorized as types such as 'food videos' , 'sports videos' , 'general humour', 'travel videos', 'perspective on life videos', e.t.c.

So, i want to create a web application that can help me do just this. the application should be designed such that I can select the folder from the device where these videos are located (source folder), I also select a folder where i want to move these videos (target folder). and then the application would take videos from the first folder, view it in a media player on a medium sized frame & then allow me rename it, and then i can also choose the type of video it is via a subcategory option list. based on the option selected it would move the video in the particular sub folder inside of the target folder. if the option i want is not present based on the video i watched, i should be able to create a new option, after which it will get added into the list of subcategory options.

there should also be a 'MOVE' button which when clicked, will move the video from the source folder to the target folder. and the move button should be disabled if the video is not selected or if the source folder or target folder is not selected or if the video is selected but the name or the subcategory is not entered.

help me make this please! also please make sure that the application is responsive to different screen sizes & different screen resolutions. and make the UI sleek and modern but also simple to use.
